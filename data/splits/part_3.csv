If the F2 key on the keyboard does not work, you might have to connect an external keyboard and access the BIOS.

If you have the invoice copy, please DM the invoice copy and leave us a message for any concerns.

You can access the BIOS by tapping on the F2 key on start-up.

Since you have mentioned that the keyboard has broken, check if the F2 keys works on the keyboard. If it works, try accessing BIOS and share a picture of the BIOS screen with the service tag.",,75180.0
